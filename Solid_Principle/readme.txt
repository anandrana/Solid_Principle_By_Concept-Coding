Solid Principle

S=> Single Responsibility => A class should have only 1 reason to change.

O=>Open for Extension but closed for modification

L=>Liskov Substitution principle=> Class B is the subtype(child) of Class A,then we should be able to
                                   replace Object of A with B without breaking of the behaviour of the
                                   program.

   Subclass should extend the capability of parent class not narrow it down(it means the parent have 3
   features then child have 3 or more features but not less then 3 features)


I=>Interface Segmented Principle=> Interfaces Should be such,that client should not implement
                                    unnecessary functions they do not need.


D=>Dependency Inversion Principle=>Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete class.
